# JoyStickTest on Java

## Description
Project goal: port JoyStickTest from C++ to Java, using an interface on JavaFX
Best adapted for windows, linux may have bugs

## Requirements
- JDK 17
- Installed GTK libraries to work with OpenGL JavaFX (linux)
- At least 256 MB of RAM

## Installation

2. Download JDK 17 to Official Site
3. Run JoyStickTest.jar

## Advantages over the original
- Determination of the application theme depending on the system theme
- Support not only for xinput gamepads, but also for dualshock 4 (and in the future for ps3 gamepads)
- A more clear and familiar interface in gamepad test
-  test works exactly the same as in the original, but in a beautiful wrapper
- Cross-platform application
